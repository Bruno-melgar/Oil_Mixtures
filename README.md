- **Description:** <br/>	
This dataset details the results of an experiment exploring the synergies and antagonistic effects of olive oil mixtures. Researchers combined different percentages of Cobrançosa and Arbequina olive oil varieties and applied multivariate analyses to assess the impact. Chemometric techniques were used to evaluate the data and identify the optimal combination based on the mixture's overall performance.
